    <h1>Week 8 Notes/Activities</h1>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I had learned to work with fetch() a different way in a different class. The other way was simpler, but during the team meeting, my team member explained that for the activity the way I learned it would be more difficult.</li>
        <li>I learned the mvc method, would be more effective to accomplished the task given us for the team activity. Rather then having to repeating code to replace the current information with the new one, I could avoid this with the MVC method and breaking
            up the different roles to achieve the task needed.</li>
    </ul>
