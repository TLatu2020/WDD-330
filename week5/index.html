        <li>While there are different ways of doing things, some cleaner with some sloppy, usually there are disadvantages to doing somethings one way compared to the other.</li>
        <li>It is important to understand that we keep to the desires of clients who we work for. Despite you wanting to add something that will help make things better, if the customer does not want it, you have to listen.</li>

    </ul>
