    <h1>Week 4 Notes/Activities</h1>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The following code was something that had caused me a lot of problems with my quiz ninja activity, score: document.querySelector('#score strong').
        </li>
        <li>
            From this I learnt that every little detail, no matter how small or insignificant, can really cause your program to function properly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Because I failed to add the strong tag in my html where the score was, my program would not function as it should. Questions would fail to alert, the hide and show would not work properly, so the start button was not working as intended.
        </li>
    </ul>
