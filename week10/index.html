    <h1>Week 10 Notes/Activities</h1>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>There are two forms of client-side validation: built-in form validation and JavaScript.</li>
        <li>Built-in form validation include required, pattern, types, such as text or email, min and max length, and min and max. These are straight forward, easy to use and perform better.</li>
        <li>JavaScript may not perform as well as built-in, but it is completely customizable. You will also need to create it yourself.</li>
        <li>Through Constraint Validation Api we are able to check for validation, from personal view it does so in a similar way as built in like checking for maxlength as an example, and you are able to create customizable message.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for accessing and manipulating parts of the HTTP pipeline.</li>
        <li>It also provides a global fetch() method that provides an easy, logical way to fetch resources asynchronously accross the network.</li>
        <li>What are some possible reasons for wanting a request to be sent with credentials? Is this something that is done to secure information?</li>
    </ul>
