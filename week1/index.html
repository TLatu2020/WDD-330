    <ul>
        <li><strong>Retrofitting</strong> : taking what you already have and making it fit on mobile. <br> - <strong>Benefits</strong>: cheaper and faster than ground up re-write, better mobile experience that desktop only. <br> - <strong> Disadvantages</strong>:
            Doesn't address screen real estate issues, nor address touch interaction issues.
        </li>

    <h3>Understanding Users</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Three things you can do to <br> 1. <strong>Be There</strong> to help move someone along their decision journey, and deepen their loyalty. <br> 2. <strong>Be Useful</strong> . Only 9% of users will stay if it doesn't satisfy their needs. Provide
            them what they came for as quickly as possible. <br> 3. <strong>Be Quick</strong> . It’s not just about fast loading, the functionality must be there as well. People don’t have attention spans anymore. The more you make them think about, the
            less happy they will be. Excessive steps will just cause frustration.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Strategic Menu Design</h3>

    <h3>Mobile Friendly Forms</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Make it simple so people can use it easily.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reduce cognitive load to make them think less.
        </li>
        <li>
            Something that can help forms look less squashed on mobile is ditch the labels and have them appear inside the form instead. Taking up less room and providing more space.
        </li>
        <li>
            Using float label when user presses on field will help solve issue of text disappearing when field clicked on.
        </li>
        <li>
            Some cases a long form is unavoidable. Something that can help is by breaking up the form, pagination. If you decide to go with this method, you should also have a progress indicator, so the user is aware of how much more of the form is left.
        </li>
        <li>
            Auto-fill can also help the annoyance of trying to fill out a full form on mobile device. This can also help reduce errors and cuts down on the time to fill in the form.
        </li>
    </ul>
