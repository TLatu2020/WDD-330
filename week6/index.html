    <h1>Week 6 Notes/Activities</h1>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            While I had a basic knowledge of how modular JavaScript works based on the readings, trying to use it in practical case can be a bit more trickier.
        </li>
        <li>
            The ToDo activity really showed me how modular JavaScript can be useful. When the program that is needed is large it can help keep things tidy and make it easier to reuse functions and methods when needed.
        </li>
        <li>
            The same thing can be said about rendering the information. I am used to having everything in the one section, so creating and displaying in the one go. I struggled with changing tasks to complete, update list and then rendering it.
        </li>
        <li>
            While it was difficult I did see how rendering can be helpful in keeping the code clean and precise. I saw how the one rendering function was the only thing that was used to display new Todos, completed Todos, and remove Todos from the list. Rather than
            having each of them doing the change and displaying it in the same process.
