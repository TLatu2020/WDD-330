            While there are plenty more useful functions that I read about this week, some that really stood out to me were Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE). It is a useful way of performing a task while keeping it's variables wrapped within it's scope
            so it does not pollute the global namespace with lots of variable names.
        </li>
        <li>
            This also leads to temporary variables. Having your temp variables within the IIFE makes sure that it is only available when the IIFE is invoked and disappears afterwards. Keeping things clean, especially when you want to do some testing.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ajax is something that allows your web applications to function more dynamically, by allowing certain parts of the page to reload without affecting the rest.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ajax allows data to be sent and received in the background, and allows certain parts of the page to repsond to the users events, while allowing the rest of the page to continue running.
        </li>
    </ul>
