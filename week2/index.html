    <ul>
        <li>Attempted to change functions in the quiz challenge, for chapter 4, to function expressions or arrow functions, but the code did not work.</li>
        <li>After looking through the code and error code, I realized that the changes would not work due to the function being called before the function is written and initialized.</li>
        <li>I realized this had something to do with function hoisting. Because function declarations are automatically hoisted, it would make sense to use it.</li>
        <li>I learnt that some situations, depending really on what you want to do how to achieve it, certain ways to define functions work better than others.</li>
    </ul>
